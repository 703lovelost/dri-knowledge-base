# DRI Knowledge Base Docs Repository

Here's all the docs that are been exported from the sources currently unavailable.

*For DRI NSU purposes only.*

## How to contribute

- Pull the `main` branch.
- Run the preview mode by running <br> `docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v ${PWD}:/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material`.
- From now on you can simply overwrite the documents' content. <br> As you save your work, the changes will be revealed on `localhost:8000` in real-time.
- If you're finished your work, create a branch and pull request related to it.

## How does Knowledge Base update

Depending on pull requests being created, I will check them and later add to the site. If some of the Markdown/LaTeX markup is needed but shown wrong, create an issue.

Ideas on updating the design or adding more plugins are warmly welcome. Check the site engine documentation on what is available to add: https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/
